\chapter*{Preface} 
I am very thankful to Eric Bartley Jul, my supervisor, for all our educational meetings. Eric has so many exciting stories to tell, and so much knowledge to convey. I want to thank Eric for academic education, thesis guidance, and his truly positive and encouraging attitude. 

I also want to thank my friends and family for support and guidance. Especially my mother, Trine, for research advice.
